Still need to make Class for: 
- input - in the 3 array list (look into how to do that in a way that links to gui interface)
- how to have a file (make fail catch for same name files)
- maybe how to upload a PNG into a file 
- ask about how to link and code so this does not mess up the GUI 


Things that we should add like...
- back button 
- some pre-entered recipes
- idk maybe a changeable background. 
- I'm already forgetting my idea.... 'Deep breath'.....
- add scroll bar
I made a classes for the input and file!
